  "conceptual_improvements": [
    "Incorporate topological defect density directly into T_\u03bc\u03bd.",
    "Model the full energy-momentum tensor (T_\u03bc\u03bd) from nadsoliton field gradients and fluctuations.",
    "Introduce a dynamic coupling factor that depends on scale (r) or information density (\u03c1).",
    "Consider higher-order curvature terms from non-linear nadsoliton dynamics.",
    "Account for quantum fluctuations of the emergent metric itself."
  ],
  "conclusion": "Initial model shows a correlation between information density and Schwarzschild metric, but R\u00b2 needs significant improvement (>0.8) through more sophisticated modeling of topological defects and the full energy-momentum tensor from nadsoliton dynamics."
